## 6.0.0-6-next.7

### Major Changes

- 292c0a37: feat!: replace deprecated request dependency by got

  This is a big refactoring of the core, fetching dependencies, improve code, more tests and better stability. This is essential for the next release, will take some time but would allow modularize more the core.

  ## Notes

  - Remove deprecated `request` by other `got`, retry improved, custom Agent ( got does not include it built-in)
  - Remove `async` dependency from storage (used by core) it was linked with proxy somehow safe to remove now
  - Refactor with promises instead callback wherever is possible
  - ~Document the API~
  - Improve testing, integration tests
  - Bugfix
  - Clean up old validations
  - Improve performance

  ## 💥 Breaking changes

  - Plugin API methods were callbacks based are returning promises, this will break current storage plugins, check documentation for upgrade.
  - Write Tarball, Read Tarball methods parameters change, a new set of options like `AbortController` signals are being provided to the `addAbortSignal` can be internally used with Streams when a request is aborted. eg: `addAbortSignal(signal, fs.createReadStream(pathName));`
  - `@verdaccio/streams` stream abort support is legacy is being deprecated removed
  - Remove AWS and Google Cloud packages for future refactoring [#2574](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/pull/2574).

### Minor Changes

- 54c58d1e: feat: add server rate limit protection to all request

  To modify custom values, use the server settings property.

  ```markdown
  server:

  ## https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit#configuration-options

  rateLimit:
  windowMs: 1000
  max: 10000
  ```

  The values are intended to be high, if you want to improve security of your server consider
  using different values.

### Patch Changes

  - @verdaccio/commons-api@10.0.0-alpha.2

## 5.0.0-alpha.1

### Major Changes

- d87fa026: feat!: experiments config renamed to flags

  - The `experiments` configuration is renamed to `flags`. The functionality is exactly the same.

  ```js
  flags: token: false;
  search: false;
  ```

  - The `self_path` property from the config file is being removed in favor of `config_file` full path.
  - Refactor `config` module, better types and utilities

- da1ee9c8: - Replace signature handler for legacy tokens by removing deprecated crypto.createDecipher by createCipheriv

  - Introduce environment variables for legacy tokens

  ### Code Improvements

  - Add debug library for improve developer experience

  ### Breaking change

  - The new signature invalidates all previous tokens generated by Verdaccio 4 or previous versions.
  - The secret key must have 32 characters long.

  ### New environment variables

  - `VERDACCIO_LEGACY_ALGORITHM`: Allows to define the specific algorithm for the token signature which by default is `aes-256-ctr`
  - `VERDACCIO_LEGACY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: By default, the token stores in the database, but using this variable allows to get it from memory

### Minor Changes

- 26b494cb: feat: add typescript project references settings

  Reading https://ebaytech.berlin/optimizing-multi-package-apps-with-typescript-project-references-d5c57a3b4440 I realized I can use project references to solve the issue to pre-compile modules on develop mode.

  It allows to navigate (IDE) trough the packages without need compile the packages.

  Add two `tsconfig`, one using the previous existing configuration that is able to produce declaration files (`tsconfig.build`) and a new one `tsconfig` which is enables [_projects references_](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html).
